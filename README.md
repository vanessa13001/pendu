# Hangman Game - Pygame

This project is an implementation of the classic **Hangman** game using the **Pygame** library. The goal of the game is to guess a word by suggesting letters, while avoiding having the character being hanged.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have **Python** and **Pygame** installed on your machine.

### Install Pygame

You can install Pygame via `pip` if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
